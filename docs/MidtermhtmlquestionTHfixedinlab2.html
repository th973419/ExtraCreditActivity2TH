    <p>Geography is the study of the world and all that is in it: its peoples, its land, air, and water, its plants and animals, and all the connections among its various parts. When you are investigating the world and its events you are dealing with geography. As you move through space in your everyday life you are observing and interacting with geography and making geographic decisions based on those encounters. You may not be aware of it but you are involved in <strong>geographic inquiry.</strong>
    <br />This mode of thinking is not unlike other research-oriented approaches, such as the scientific method; however, it has one big difference: space. Knowing where something is, how its location influences its characteristics, and how its location influences relationships with other phenomena are the foundation of geographic thinking. This mode of investigation asks you to see the world and all that is in it in spatial terms. Like other research methods, it also asks you to explore, analyze, and act upon the things you find. It also is important to recognize that this is the same method used by professionals around the world working to address social, economic, political, environmental, and a range of scientific issues. They, like you, have geography and GIS as key organizers.

    <div id= "Picture"><p>Think about a topic or place, and identify something interesting or significant about it. Spin that observation into the form of a question, such as <em> &#34; Why do these particular trees show signs of stress?” &#34;</em> or <em> &#34;"How do the types of businesses change as we move along this street?” &#34; </em> or <em> &#34;"What does it matter if that whole area is cleared of trees?"&#34;</em><br />For more information, visit this site: <a href= "https://storymaps.acrgis.com/stories/939b0102d1bb4af380edc6d">Getting to Know GeoInquiries</a></p></div>
